In this iteration, we generated a 100x100 random matrix filled with random 0s and 1s to represent a dummy relation. We tried running this matrix for different sizes and relations starting from 4x4 to 100x100.

We used performance.now to measure precise timing(sub-millisecond precision)for each value of N.
